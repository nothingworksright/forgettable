## About  

Bremertown Chatroom is another chat. The goal of this chatroom project is to be simple but look nice. Enter a nickname and begin chatting instantly. No password required, no sign-up process, no database, no centrally saved chat history.  

Inspired by the city of [Bremerton, WA, USA](http://www.ci.bremerton.wa.us/), but open to everyone.
