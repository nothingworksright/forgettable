## About  

Forgettable is an ephemeral chatroom.  

The goals of this chatroom project are to remain simple and temporary. Enter a nickname and begin chatting instantly. No password required, no sign-up process, no database, and no centrally saved chat history (making the chat history ephemeral and forgettable).
